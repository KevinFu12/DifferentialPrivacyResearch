# DifferentialPrivacyResearch

Welcome to the **Differential Privacy Research** repository!  
This repository supports our research methodology in computer science courses, focusing on differential privacy concepts and applications.

## ðŸ“š Overview
Differential privacy provides a mathematical foundation for privacy-preserving data analysis. This repo contains Jupyter Notebooks exploring:
- Core concepts and techniques in differential privacy
- Implementations of common mechanisms (e.g., Laplace, Exponential)
- Visualizations and experiments illustrating privacy-utility tradeoffs

## Contains
- `.ipynb` â€” Main Jupyter Notebooks with code and experiments
- `.csv` â€” Datasets
- This `README.md`
